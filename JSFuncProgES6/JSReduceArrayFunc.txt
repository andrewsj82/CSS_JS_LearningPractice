		/* JS Reduce Array Function */

//Reduce allows us to take an array and reduce it to a single data value, such as
//finding the sum or average.you can see the generic code syntax below


	myArray.reduce((acc, element) => {
	  ...
	  return ...	//i.e. return acc + element
	});

//the acc argument is the accumulator, for storing the total as it loops through the
//array. you must also pass the reduce function a starting number in the return
//statement, as below.

	const SUM = myArray.reduce((acc, element) => {
	  return acc + element, 0)	

//Example 1: find array sum
	
	const Numbers = [5,7,2,40,32,13,8,4,11]
	const Sum = Numbers.reduce((acc), x) => {
	  console.log(`acc is ${acc}`);
	  console.log(`x is ${x}`);
	  return acc + x;
	}, 0)

	>>>acc is 0
	>>>x is 5

	>>>acc is 5 
	>>>x is 7

	>>>acc is 12
	>>>x is 2.......

//Example 2: product of array numbers (has starting number of 1 due to multiply by 0)


	const Product = Numbers.reduce((acc), x) => {
	  console.log(`acc is ${acc}`);
	  console.log(`x is ${x}`);
	  return acc * x;
	}, 1)
